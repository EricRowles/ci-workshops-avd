## **ATD Dual Datacenter Topology**

![ATD Dual DC Topo](images/dual-dc-topo.png)

The ATD Dual Data Center Topology above is used in this example to create an L2LS Multi-site topology below.  The IP Network cloud is comprised of the border and core nodes in the ATD topology.  The IP Network and hosts are pre-provisioned in this example.  Our focus will be building AVD data models for Site 1 and Site 2 and configuring each site to connect to an existing IP Network.
